# Weather App

The idea to create the Weather App emerged during a study process of SwiftUI and Async/Await. Based on two videos, I assembled the main structure and, once the idea was developed, I adapted and included the features I wanted the app to have, such as real weather/temperature data, requested from the OpenWeather API.
